## Port 23
### Vulnerabilities that we are unable to exploit
* The HTTP server in AsusWRT has a flaw where it allows an unauthenticated client to perform a POST in certain cases. This can be combined with another vulnerability in the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly from the POST request to enable a special command mode. This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is running on port UDP 9999 to directly execute commands as root. This exploit leverages that to start telnetd in a random port, and then connects to it. It has been tested with the RT-AC68U running AsusWRT Version 3.0.0.4.380.7743.

### Potential Impacts
**Vulnerability 1: HTTP Server Flaw**
- Unauthenticated client can perform a POST request.
- This can be combined with another vulnerability in the VPN configuration upload routine.

**Vulnerability 2: VPN Configuration Vulnerability**
- NVRAM configuration variables are set directly from the POST request.
- This can enable a special command mode that can be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr.

**Vulnerability 3: Telnetd Exploit**
- An unauthenticated client can start telnetd in a random port.
- This allows the client to connect to the server and execute commands as root.
### Mitigation Strategies
**Vulnerability 1: POST Request Flaw**
- Implement input validation to ensure the client sends a proper POST request.
- Use a library or extension to validate the POST request body.
- Use a firewall to block any unauthorized POST requests.

**Vulnerability 2: VPN Configuration Upload**
- Use a secure configuration management tool to manage VPN configuration.
- Use a VPN server with strong authentication and access control.
- Use a VPN client with a built-in vulnerability scanner.

**Vulnerability 3: UDP Packet Exploitation**
- Use a firewall to block any UDP traffic on port UDP 9999.

## Port 2121
### Vulnerabilities that we are unable to exploit
* This module abuses a command injection vulnerability in the Nagios3 history.cgi script.

### Potential Impacts
**Vulnerability 1: Command Injection**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server, including installing malicious software, taking control of the server, or deleting important files.


**Vulnerability 2: Unrestricted File Access**
- An attacker could access any file on the server, including sensitive information, logs, and configuration files.


**Vulnerability 3: Server-Side Script Injection**

**Vulnerability 4: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the Nagios3 history.cgi script, which could then be executed by any user who visits the server's web page. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card information.
### Mitigation Strategies
