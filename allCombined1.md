**Vulnerabilities:**
* The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
	* Its CVE number is CVE-2012-0814. 
	* Its CVSS score is 3.5. 
	* Its CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N
* OpenSSH 4.4 up to versions before 4.9 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the sshd_config ForceCommand directive by modifying the .ssh/rc session file.
	* Its CVE number is CVE-2008-1657. 
	* Its CVSS score is 6.5. 
	* Its CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P
* Multiple integer overflows in the glob implementation in libc in OpenBSD before 4.9 might allow context-dependent attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted string, related to the GLOB_APPEND and GLOB_DOOFFS flags, a different issue than CVE-2011-0418.
	* Its CVE number is CVE-2011-2168. 
	* Its CVSS score is 5.0. 
	* Its CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P
* ssh-keysign.c in ssh-keysign in OpenSSH before 5.8p2 on certain platforms executes ssh-rand-helper with unintended open file descriptors, which allows local users to obtain sensitive key information via the ptrace system call.
	* Its CVE number is CVE-2011-4327. 
	* Its CVSS score is 2.1. 
	* Its CVSS vector is AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N
* Error handling in the SSH protocol in (1) SSH Tectia Client and Server and Connector 4.0 through 4.4.11, 5.0 through 5.2.4, and 5.3 through 5.3.8; Client and Server and ConnectSecure 6.0 through 6.0.4; Server for Linux on IBM System z 6.0.4; Server for IBM z/OS 5.5.1 and earlier, 6.0.0, and 6.0.1; and Client 4.0-J through 4.3.3-J and 4.0-K through 4.3.10-K; and (2) OpenSSH 4.7p1 and possibly other versions, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors.
	* Its CVE number is CVE-2008-5161. 
	* Its CVSS score is 2.6. 
	* Its CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N

# Vulnerability Mitigation Strategies

**Vulnerability 1: auth_parse_options function**

* Disable debug messages by setting the SSH_DEBUG environment variable to "none".
* Use a more secure configuration option, such as `AuthorizedKeysFile` or `AuthorizedKeysFileTimeout`.
* Implement additional security measures, such as using a dedicated key for authentication.

**Vulnerability 2: sshd_config ForceCommand directive bypass**

* Use a more secure configuration option, such as `PermitEmptyCommand`.
* Disable the `PermitUserEnvironment` option.
* Use a strong password for the `PermitRootLogin` option.

**Vulnerability 3: Multiple integer overflows in the glob implementation**

* Use a secure implementation of the `glob` function, such as `globstar`.
* Sanitize user-supplied strings before using them in the `glob` function.
* Use a library that provides secure string manipulation functions.

**Vulnerability 4: ssh-keysign.c open file descriptors**

* Use a secure implementation of the `ssh-rand-helper` function, such as using a library that provides secure random number generation.
* Use a secure key management mechanism, such as using a dedicated key management tool.
* Avoid using `ptrace` for key generation.

**Vulnerability 5: Error handling in SSH protocol**

* Use a secure error handling mechanism, such as using a library that provides secure error handling.
* Sanitize user-supplied strings before using them in the error handling code.
* Use a robust logging mechanism, such as using a secure logging library.

**Vulnerability 6: CBC mode vulnerability**

* Disable the use of block cipher algorithms in SSH.
* Use a secure alternative cipher algorithm, such as AES.
* Use a strong key management mechanism, such as using a dedicated key management tool.<eos>
