<bos>Write the executive summary of the penetration testing report for a network with the below vulnerabilities:
The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory. CVSS score is 3.5
OpenSSH 4.4 up to versions before 4.9 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the sshd_config ForceCommand directive by modifying the .ssh/rc session file. CVSS score is 6.5
Multiple integer overflows in the glob implementation in libc in OpenBSD before 4.9 might allow context-dependent attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted string, related to the GLOB_APPEND and GLOB_DOOFFS flags, a different issue than CVE-2011-0418. CVSS score is 5.0
ssh-keysign.c in ssh-keysign in OpenSSH before 5.8p2 on certain platforms executes ssh-rand-helper with unintended open file descriptors, which allows local users to obtain sensitive key information via the ptrace system call. CVSS score is 2.1
Error handling in the SSH protocol in (1) SSH Tectia Client and Server and Connector 4.0 through 4.4.11, 5.0 through 5.2.4, and 5.3 through 5.3.8; Client and Server and ConnectSecure 6.0 through 6.0.4; Server for Linux on IBM System z 6.0.4; Server for IBM z/OS 5.5.1 and earlier, 6.0.0, and 6.0.1; and Client 4.0-J through 4.3.3-J and 4.0-K through 4.3.10-K; and (2) OpenSSH 4.7p1 and possibly other versions, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors. CVSS score is 2.6

## Penetration Testing Report

**Vulnerabilities:**

* auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages.
* OpenSSH 4.4 up to versions before 4.9 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the sshd_config ForceCommand directive by modifying the .ssh/rc session file.
* Multiple integer overflows in the glob implementation in libc in OpenBSD before 4.9 might allow context-dependent attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted string, related to the GLOB_APPEND and GLOB_DOOFFS flags.
* ssh-keysign.c in ssh-keysign in OpenSSH before 5.8p2 on certain platforms executes ssh-rand-helper with unintended open file descriptors, which allows local users to obtain sensitive key information via the ptrace system call.

**Recommendations:**

* Upgrade OpenSSH to version 4.9 or later.
* Disable the auth_parse_options function in OpenSSH.
* Use a strong password for the .ssh directory.
* Use a firewall to block unauthorized access to the server.

**Additional Information:**

* This report is based on a penetration test conducted on a hypothetical network.
* The vulnerabilities listed in this report may not be present on all OpenSSH versions.
* The severity of these vulnerabilities may vary depending on the specific configuration of the server.
